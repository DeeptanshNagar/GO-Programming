My personal collection of Go programs as I explore this awesome language. Started as a learning repo, but it's grown into something I'm genuinely proud of. If you're learning Go too, hopefully this helps!

## 🎯 What You'll Find Here

**📘 Fundamentals** - Variables, functions, structs - the building blocks  
**⚡ Concurrency** - Goroutines and channels (my favorite Go feature!)  
**🌐 Web Development** - HTTP servers, REST APIs, real-world examples  
**🛠️ CLI Tools** - Command line programs I actually use in my workflow  
**🎨 Projects** - Bigger applications where I put it all together  

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and explore
git clone https://github.com/DeeptanshNagar/GO-Programming.git
cd GO-Programming

# Jump into any example
go run basics/hello-world/main.go

# Try out a project
cd projects/task-manager
go mod tidy && go run .
```

## 💡 My Learning Path

Started with zero Go knowledge and fell in love with its simplicity. Here's how I structured my learning:

1. **Day 1-2**: Syntax, basic types, functions
2. **Day 3-4**: Structs, interfaces, error handling  
3. **Day 5-6**: Goroutines, channels, real concurrency
4. **Ongoing**: Web servers, databases, performance optimization

### Things I Learned the Hard Way
- Error handling isn't optional in Go (and that's actually great)
- Interfaces are simpler than you think - embrace them
- `gofmt` and `golint` will save your sanity
- Context matters more than you realize for production code

## 🛠️ Projects I'm Proud Of

### 📝 **Task Manager CLI**
A todo app I built and actually use every day. Simple but powerful.
```bash
cd projects/task-cli && go run .
```

### 🔍 **Log Parser**
Born out of frustration debugging server logs at work. Parses and analyzes log files with Go's awesome concurrency.

### 🌐 **URL Shortener**
Complete web service with database, API, and web interface. My first "real" Go web app.

### 📊 **System Monitor**
Real-time system stats using goroutines. Great example of Go's concurrent programming model.

## 🤝 Contributing

Found something broken? Have a cool Go example to add? I'd love your help!

- 🐛 **Bug reports** - Open an issue with details
- 💡 **New examples** - Fork, add your code, send a PR
- 📝 **Documentation** - Help make things clearer
- ⭐ **Feedback** - Tell me what's working or what's not

Just follow basic Go conventions and add tests where it makes sense.

## 📚 Resources That Actually Helped
